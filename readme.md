# An xPath Tester For FireFox! (Hopefully)

Since there is very little working here to note, this is a todo list so I don't get lost.

- Look into switching to ESBuild, Webpack, Vite, or something that won't force me to write all the js in one script.

- Trash the current listener / sender setup since it sucks and I need it to work before I try anything

- Tear out anything that is doing more than the bare minimum (we'll get there but now is not then)

- Hard reset on html, currently really disorganized.
  - Look into using react or some mini version to make reusing elements and general scripting easier

The end goal of this repo is to create a code base that can generate a working extension compatible with both manifest v2 (firefox) and v3 (chromium)

- Firefox comes first since I am yet to find a decent xPath tester for FF, and I need it for work.

## JUST GET THE DAMN THING WORKING!!!
- everything else can come after and will be much easier if you just work on creating a solid proof of concept instead of trying to think of every case from the start.
